- 👋 Hi, I’m Julia!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new and exciting things.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying my hands at ML.
- 💞️ Just forking and uploading bits and bobs of code. 

Code some might find interesting:

- [Script to automatically log in and delete posts in a php forum](https://github.com/liluuen/bym_script)
- [SQL Project (incl. vizualisation in matplotlib, math/statistics, answering business questions)](https://github.com/liluuen/SQL)
- [Vizualisation of Temp/pressure over time (made for my BA)]()
